## Introduction

The main objective behind this application is to classify SMS/Email as spam or not spam using machine learning. With an ever-growing demand to communicate in professional settings such as institutes and workplaces, especially during times when remote communication became essential, the risk of encountering spam has significantly increased.

Unfortunately, this environment also provides fertile ground for spammers who exploit it to execute fraudulent activities. To combat this, our application utilizes Python, a powerful tool for building machine learning models, to help distinguish spam from legitimate messages. By automating the detection of spam, this application contributes to reducing cybercrimes and simplifying the digital lives of users.

The project leverages **Naive Bayes Classifiers**, a family of algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, which presumes independence between predictive features. This theorem is crucial for calculating the likelihood of a message being spam based on various characteristics of the data.
